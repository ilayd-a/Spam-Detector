# Spam-Detector

Identifies the spam messages using neural networks. This is mainly made to practice TensorFlow and machine learning. I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification) dataset from Kaggle. The results are pretty good, with a val_accuracy of 0.9465. I highly recommend using this as a guide to learn TensorFlow or as a guide for beginner-level machine learning projects!Â
